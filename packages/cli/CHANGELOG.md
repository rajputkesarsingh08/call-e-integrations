### Patch Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/pull/94) [`a7e5439`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/a7e5439eb2a9e1870b937106c562afd6042161c7) Thanks [@JJasonSun](https://github.com/JJasonSun)! - Normalize JSON object payloads from content-only MCP tool results into
  `structuredContent` while preserving the raw result envelope, and document the
  direct MCP and CLI output paths.

- [#119](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/pull/119) [`e752bf2`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/e752bf23a0c4732e1740e07302defc49f0aa14ee) Thanks [@JJasonSun](https://github.com/JJasonSun)! - Accept `--source`, `--integration`, and `--integration-version` as per-invocation attribution overrides. Validate values before requests and preserve environment-variable compatibility.

- [#115](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/pull/115) [`826905b`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/826905b7ca4cbf185f08c432eeaa2b1bf69e18cc) Thanks [@JJasonSun](https://github.com/JJasonSun)! - Run agent commands through a bundled launcher that verifies the MCP package and help before passing JSON argument arrays without a shell. Preserve structured login, help, and recovery arguments and integration attribution across Bash, PowerShell, and cmd, including installations with SDK releases that also export `calle`.

- Updated dependencies [[`a7e5439`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/a7e5439eb2a9e1870b937106c562afd6042161c7)]:

  15-second default for other MCP requests and explicit `--timeout-seconds`
  overrides.
- Updated dependencies [[`e966ea7`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/e966ea7c7b63e591e8952452a7bba8eda67e9871)]:

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/pull/73) [`89a5237`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/89a5237f9b0a8d82a79752c4f09dde2a8c9f9ba9) Thanks [@EazyHood](https://github.com/EazyHood)! - Reject duration flags that are not plain numbers, and bound the ones backed by a timer.

  `--timeout-seconds 30s` used to resolve to `NaN`, which reached the MCP timeout arithmetic where `Math.max(NaN, 1000)` stays `NaN` and `setTimeout` substitutes 1ms, so every call aborted before it left. Durations are now validated where they are read, with the offending flag named in the error.

  The constraints are per option rather than shared: `--min-ttl-seconds 0` keeps working, since zero disables the minimum remaining-lifetime window, while the timeout flags stay strictly positive. Timer-backed values are also capped at 2147483 seconds, because `setTimeout` collapses any longer delay to 1ms and would reproduce the same immediate abort.

- Updated dependencies [[`89a5237`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/89a5237f9b0a8d82a79752c4f09dde2a8c9f9ba9)]:

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/pull/71) [`bc70f48`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/bc70f486e996b7aff845c11242838d4e11e5e079) Thanks [@EazyHood](https://github.com/EazyHood)! - Open the browser without cmd.exe on Windows during `auth login`.

  `cmd /c start "" <url>` let cmd parse the OAuth URL, and `&` is a command separator there, so the URL was truncated at the first `&` (losing `redirect_uri`, `state` and `scope`) and the rest of the query string was run as shell commands. The opener is now `rundll32`, which takes the URL as a single argument, named by its fully qualified `%SystemRoot%\System32` path so the executable is not resolved through the current working directory.

- Updated dependencies [[`566008b`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/commit/566008bab86008bc9019c45478122beeaffa5f60)]:
