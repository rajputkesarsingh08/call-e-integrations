# Install The CALL-E Claude Code Plugin

The Claude Code plugin provides the `/calle:calle` skill. It uses the
shared `calle` CLI so authentication can be checked and recovered from Claude
Code without opening the native remote MCP authorization menu.

## Prerequisites

Install a Claude Code version that supports plugins and local shell command
execution. Check your version with:

```bash
claude --version
```

## Install

In Claude Code, add the latest released marketplace from this repository:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations.git#@call-e/claude-plugin@latest
```

Then install the plugin:

```text
/plugin install calle@call-e-claude
```

Reload plugins in the current Claude Code session so the installed skill is
available without restarting:

```text
/reload-plugins
```

`@call-e/claude-plugin@latest` is a Git tag updated by the release workflow after `@call-e/claude-plugin` publishes. For a reproducible install, replace it with a package-level release tag such as `@call-e/claude-plugin@<version>`.

## Authorize

The plugin checks authentication when `/calle:calle` is invoked.

Follow [CLI entry point selection](../../packages/cli/docs/cli-reference.md#selecting-the-cli-entry-point)
to select the trusted MCP package and prepare the launcher and `request.json`.
The JSON arrays below are values for that request's `argv`; execute them one
at a time with `node run-agent-command.mjs request.json`.

To pre-authorize before using the skill, run:

```json
["auth", "login"]
```

The command opens the CALL-E browser authorization flow, waits for completion,
then stores the token in the private local CLI cache. To verify setup:

```json
["auth", "status"]
```

```json
["mcp", "tools"]
```

The plugin reuses the verified entry point for every CLI command. Commands run
by the skill include this CALL-E attribution:

```json
{"integration": {"source": "claude", "name": "claude_code_plugin", "version": "0.2.3"}}
```

## Use

Invoke:

```text
/calle:calle
```

Claude Code will use CALL-E for setup checks, call planning, planned call
execution, and call status checks. If authentication is missing or expired, the
skill runs blocking `calle auth login`, shows the browser authorization URL,
and continues after authorization completes.
